# Bombercat

This is a proof of concept project using FXGL's library. The main objective is to implement a functional bomberman game from scratch and add features that 
separates this game from the original, improving some aspects of gameplay.

Today (as november 2020) there's some bugs to be fixed and some features to be added. This is a work in progress! Don't judge it too harshly!
